# Elevator system v1.0

The Elevator system is my first-ever project as a student, and it is an open-source software. It is written in the C language and designed to manage elevators in a building with two panels - the Admin Panel and the User Panel.

The Admin Panel is the control center of the system. Administrators can create other users and grant them permissions to access the system. They can create and edit elevators, view their status, and reset the number of uses and repair flags on each elevator. The system allows for administrators to unblock elevators that have been previously blocked.

Each elevator has a unique number of uses before a repair flag appears, indicating that maintenance is required. The administrator can reset this flag if required.

On the User Panel, users must activate elevators before usage. Once activated, they have access to the elevators, which have a basic interface (as demonstrated in the preview). If an elevator has a repair flag, it will not be available for use until maintenance has been carried out.

The system provides an easy-to-use interface for both administrators and users, making it simple to manage and use elevators in a building. It provides an efficient way to track elevator usage, monitor their condition, and ensure that maintenance is carried out promptly.
